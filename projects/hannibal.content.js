  overviewTitle: "Overview",
  overview: "Built in Unity with Vuforia for AR verification, Hannibal blends history learning with gameplay. Players start from a menu with mini-games (crosswords, family tree, and more), then move into a guided voyage flow where they scan cards in sequence (character, place, time, environment, then map). After validation, the map appears in 3D and can be explored to complete level objectives and unlock story episodes in chronological order.",
